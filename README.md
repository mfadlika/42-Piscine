# 42KL-Piscine

These are all projects I have learnt and done from Piscine 16 May - 10 June 2022 in 42 Kuala Lumpur.

All of these works are ofcourse with many helps from my peers.

These projects are meant to recreate some basic functions of C Language.

There are still many flaws in my code, some even didn't pass the moulinette.

So let me intro you of the moulinette.

The moulinette is 'maybe' an AI that will checks all of your projects whether it is correct or not, sometimes your code works but the the moulinette still won't pass them.

This is why you need your peers, you just can ask everyone in class because maybe they know things you don't, or sometimes they ask you because you know things they don't.

Besides my projects I push here in my github, there were other things we did in class, one of them is Rush.

Rush is a team project where you and 2-4 other team members are asked to finish a project only in 2 days. We were in a rush but still fun to do with your peers.

Also, there were exams every Friday, exam was meant to measure our knowledge of our projects we've done and final exam at the end of the Piscine.

And besides all fun of C Language, we had other kind of fun, here you can befriend with amazing and so damn genius people who are ready to help you 24/7.

Many activities you can do here with your new friends besides of C Language and stuff. Ping Pong you can do downstair.

Or maybe you want to do something more fun, ice skating or maybe do other sports, ofcourse you can.

Okay sorry for long intro, I'm not good at writing README.md and this is my first time.

Wish all of us the best. Don't give up.
